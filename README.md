# WEATHER APPLICATION BY ROBERT EFROS

## REQUIREMENTS

NODE version 16 and above

\*Recommending using NVM in order to choose needed version

## INSTRUCTIONS

I advice using Yarn for installation, since npm often fails on different systems.

Application can be started with either yarn or npm.

"npm run start" or "yarn start".
